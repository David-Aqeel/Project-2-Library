# Library App


## App Title: Library

This app is for readers! 
It helps you create lists of books to organize your reading. 
You can make a list for books read, books you are currently reading, and books you want to read, or any other lists you can think of. 
You can name them as you see fit.

This app is fairly simple to use.

Then you can click into the list and add/remove books, and edit the list name.

## Next Steps: 

Planned future enhancements (icebox items):

I plan on adding more book details other than the name, for example 'Author'.

I would like to make a review page for each book, and a checklist system that automatically transfers books from 'To Read' to 'Reading' to 'Already Read'.
